# Playback
Playback is a project I had so much fun building. It is a music streaming application that is built ontop of the deezer music api. The technologies used are React & Redux. Feel free to do whatever you want with the codebase.

## Installation
git clone https://github.com/the-bionic/playback.git
cd playback
npm install
npm start
