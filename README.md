# Playback
Playback is a project I had so much **fun** building. It is a music streaming application that is built with the deezer music api. The technologies used are React, Redux and styled-components. Feel free to do whatever you want with the codebase.

## Installation
Make sure you have node installed on your local computer.

* git clone https://github.com/the-bionic/playback.git 
* cd playback
* npm install
* npm start
